# Facebook Messenger Frontend Clone
I made this FB messenger clone to help improve my React.js and CSS skills; no external CSS libraries were used in this project. The messages for each conversation were generated with Faker.js, and the icons are from React Icons. React's useContext hook was used for simple state management. Best enjoyed on a computer.

Example of a conversation:

Ternary operators determine when to display the profile picture of the friend

Search function will filter through the friend list using ES6 array functions:

What's next?
* I would like to turn this into a fullstack app that has real time storage for conversations.
* Going further, I would also like to implement a login/authentication system, possibly utilizing Facebook's API as well.
