# Facebook Messenger Frontend Clone
I made this FB messenger clone to help improve my React.js and CSS skills; no external CSS libraries were used in this project. The messages for each conversation were generated with Faker.js, and the icons are from React Icons. Best enjoyed on a computer. React's useContext hook was used for simple state management.

Example of a conversation:

Ternary operators determine when to display the profile picture of the friend

Search function will filter through the friend's list using ES6 array functions:

What's next?
* I would like to turn this into a fullstack app that has real time storage for conversations.
* Going further, I would also like to implement a login/authentication system, possibly utilizing Facebook's API as well.
