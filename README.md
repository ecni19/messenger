# Facebook Messenger Frontend Clone
I made this FB messenger clone to help improve my React.js and CSS skills. The messages for each conversation were generated with Faker.js, and the icons are from React Icons. Best enjoyed on a computer. React's useContext hook was used for simple state management.

What's next?
* I would like to turn this into a fullstack app that has real time storage for conversations.
* Going further, I would also like to implement a login/authentication system, possibly utilizing Facebook's API as well.
